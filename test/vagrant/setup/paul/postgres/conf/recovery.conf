# PostgreSQL recovery config file
# -------------------------------
#
# Edit this file to provide the parameters that PostgreSQL needs to
# perform an archive recovery of a database, or to act as a replication
# standby.
#
# If "recovery.conf" is present in the PostgreSQL data directory, it is
# read on postmaster startup.  After successful recovery, it is renamed
# to "recovery.done" to ensure that we do not accidentally re-enter
# archive recovery or standby mode.
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STREAMING PARAMETERS
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# below parameters should be set for streaming replication servers

# standby_mode
# When standby_mode is enabled, the PostgreSQL server will work as a
# standby. It will continuously wait for the additional XLOG records, using
# restore_command and/or primary_conninfo.

standby_mode = on

# primary_conninfo
# If set, the PostgreSQL server will try to connect to the primary using this
# connection string and receive XLOG records continuously.
# Required for streaming replication

primary_conninfo = 'host=john port=5432 user=replicator application_name=paul'

# recovery_target_timeline
# Set to 'latest' to follow the master if it switches timeline
# requires version 9.3 or WAL file archiving to be effective

recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
